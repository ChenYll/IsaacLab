msgid "This tutorial shows how to interact with an articulated robot in the simulation. It is a continuation of the :ref:`tutorial-interact-rigid-object` tutorial, where we learned how to interact with a rigid object. On top of setting the root state, we will see how to set the joint state and apply commands to the articulated robot."

msgid "Similar to the previous tutorial, we populate the scene with a ground plane and a distant light. Instead of spawning rigid objects, we now spawn a cart-pole articulation from its USD file. The cart-pole is a simple robot consisting of a cart and a pole attached to it. The cart is free to move along the x-axis, and the pole is free to rotate about the cart. The USD file for the cart-pole contains the robot's geometry, joints, and other physical properties."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/tutorials/01_assets/run_articulation.rst:42
msgid "For the cart-pole, we use its pre-defined configuration object, which is an instance of the :class:`assets.ArticulationCfg` class. This class contains information about the articulation's spawning strategy, default initial state, actuator models for different joints, and other meta-information. A deeper-dive into how to create this configuration object is provided in the :ref:`how-to-write-articulation-config` tutorial."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/tutorials/01_assets/run_articulation.rst:47
msgid "As seen in the previous tutorial, we can spawn the articulation into the scene in a similar fashion by creating an instance of the :class:`assets.Articulation` class by passing the configuration object to its constructor."

#: ../../source/tutorials/01_assets/run_articulation.rst:69
msgid "To reset the articulation, we first set the root state by calling the :meth:`Articulation.write_root_state_to_sim` method. Similarly, we set the joint states by calling the :meth:`Articulation.write_joint_state_to_sim` method. Finally, we call the :meth:`Articulation.reset` method to reset any internal buffers and caches."

msgid "In this tutorial, we control the articulation using joint effort commands. For this to work, we need to set the articulation's stiffness and damping parameters to zero. This is done a-priori inside the cart-pole's pre-defined configuration object."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/tutorials/01_assets/run_articulation.rst:91
msgid "At every step, we randomly sample joint efforts and set them to the articulation by calling the :meth:`Articulation.set_joint_effort_target` method. After setting the targets, we call the :meth:`Articulation.write_data_to_sim` method to write the data to the PhysX buffer. Finally, we step the simulation."
