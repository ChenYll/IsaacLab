msgid "In the previous tutorials, we learned the essential workings of the standalone script and how to spawn different objects (or *prims*) into the simulation. This tutorial shows how to create and interact with a rigid object. For this, we will use the :class:`assets.RigidObject` class provided in Isaac Lab."

msgid "A distinction between these two steps is necessary because the second step only happens after the first step is complete and the simulator is reset. Once the simulator is reset (which automatically plays the simulation), no new (physics-enabled) prims should be added to the scene as it may lead to unexpected behaviors. However, the prims can be interacted with through their respective handles."

This class is responsible for spawning the prims at the input path and initializes their corresponding rigid body physics handles."

msgid "In this tutorial, we create a conical rigid object using the spawn configuration similar to the rigid cone in the :ref:`Spawn Objects <tutorial-spawn-prims>` tutorial. The only difference is that now we wrap the spawning configuration into the :class:`assets.RigidObjectCfg` class. This class contains information about the asset's spawning strategy, default initial state, and other meta-information. When this class is passed to the :class:`assets.RigidObject` class, it spawns the object and initializes the corresponding physics handles when the simulation is played."

msgid "As an example on spawning the rigid object prim multiple times, we create its parent Xform prims, ``/World/Origin{i}``, that correspond to different spawn locations. When the regex expression ``/World/Origin*/Cone`` is passed to the :class:`assets.RigidObject` class, it spawns the rigid object prim at each of the ``/World/Origin{i}`` locations. For instance, if ``/World/Origin1`` and ``/World/Origin2`` are present in the scene, the rigid object prims are spawned at the locations ``/World/Origin1/Cone`` and ``/World/Origin2/Cone`` respectively."

For the convenience of this tutorial, we extract the rigid object's entity from the scene dictionary and store it in a variable."

msgid "To reset the simulation state of the spawned rigid object prims, we need to set their pose and velocity. Together they define the root state of the spawned rigid objects. It is important to note that this state is defined in the **simulation world frame**, and not of their parent Xform prim. This is because the physics engine only understands the world frame and not the parent Xform prim's frame. Thus, we need to transform desired state of the rigid object prim into the world frame before setting it."

msgid "We use the :attr:`assets.RigidObject.data.default_root_state` attribute to get the default root state of the spawned rigid object prims. This default state can be configured from the :attr:`assets.RigidObjectCfg.init_state` attribute, which we left as identity in this tutorial. We then randomize the translation of the root state and set the desired state of the rigid object prim using the :meth:`assets.RigidObject.write_root_state_to_sim` method. As the name suggests, this method writes the root state of the rigid object prim into the simulation buffer."
