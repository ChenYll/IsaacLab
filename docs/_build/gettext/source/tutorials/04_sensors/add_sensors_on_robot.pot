msgid "While the asset classes allow us to create and simulate the physical embodiment of the robot, sensors help in obtaining information about the environment. They typically update at a lower frequency than the simulation and are useful for obtaining different proprioceptive and exteroceptive information. For example, a camera sensor can be used to obtain the visual information of the environment, and a contact sensor can be used to obtain the contact information of the robot with the environment."
