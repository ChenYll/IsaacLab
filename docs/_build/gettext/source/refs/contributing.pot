msgstr ""

#: ../../source/refs/contributing.rst:79
msgid "However, in our codebase, we encounter circular imports at a sub-package level. This situation arises due to our specific code structure. We organize classes or functions and their corresponding configuration objects into separate files. This separation enhances code readability and maintainability. Nevertheless, it can result in circular imports because, in many configuration objects, we specify classes or functions as default values using the attributes ``class_type`` and ``func`` respectively."

#: ../../source/refs/contributing.rst:85
msgid "To address circular imports, we leverage the `typing.TYPE_CHECKING <https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.TYPE_CHECKING>`_ variable.
