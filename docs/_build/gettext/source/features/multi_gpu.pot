msgid "For complex reinforcement learning environments, it may be desirable to scale up training across multiple GPUs. This is possible in Isaac Lab through the use of the `PyTorch distributed <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/distributed.html>`_ framework."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/features/multi_gpu.rst:23
msgid "The :meth:`torch.distributed` API is used to launch multiple processes of training, where the number of processes must be equal to or less than the number of GPUs available. Each process runs on a dedicated GPU and launches its own instance of Isaac Sim and the Isaac Lab environment. Each process collects its own rollouts during the training process and has its own copy of the policy network. During training, gradients are aggregated across the processes and broadcasted back to the process at the end of the epoch."
