msgid "When a USD prim has physics schemas applied on it, it is affected by physics simulation. This means that the prim can move, rotate, and collide with other prims in the simulation world. However, there are cases where it is desirable to make certain prims static in the simulation world, i.e. the prim should still participate in collisions but its position and orientation should not change."

msgid "Static colliders are prims that are not affected by physics but can collide with other prims in the simulation world. These don't have any rigid body properties applied on them. However, this also means that they can't be accessed using the physics tensor API (i.e., through the :class:`assets.RigidObject` class)."

This is different from PhysX considering the articulation as a fixed-base system. Hence, the simulation may not behave as expected."

However, to make the PhysX parser consider the articulation as a fixed-base system, the articulation root properties are removed from the root rigid body prim and applied to its parent prim instead."
