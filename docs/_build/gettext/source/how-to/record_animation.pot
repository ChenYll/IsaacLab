msgid "Omniverse includes tools to record animations of physics simulations. The `Stage Recorder`_ extension listens to all the motion and USD property changes within a USD stage and records them to a USD file. This file contains the time samples of the changes, which can be played back to render the animation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/how-to/record_animation.rst:10
msgid "The timeSampled USD file only contains the changes to the stage. It uses the same hierarchy as the original stage at the time of recording. This allows adding the animation to the original stage, or to a different stage with the same hierarchy. The timeSampled file can be directly added as a sublayer to the original stage to play back the animation."

#: ../../source/how-to/record_animation.rst:17
msgid "Omniverse only supports playing animation or playing physics on a USD prim at the same time. If you want to play back the animation of a USD prim, you need to disable the physics simulation on the prim."

msgid "In Isaac Lab, we directly use the `Stage Recorder`_ extension to record the animation of the physics simulation. This is available as a feature in the :class:`~omni.isaac.lab.envs.ui.BaseEnvWindow` class. However, to record the animation of a simulation, you need to disable `Fabric`_ to allow reading and writing all the changes (such as motion and USD properties) to the USD stage."

msgid "On running the script, the Isaac Lab UI window opens with the button \"Record Animation\" in the toolbar. Clicking this button starts recording the animation of the simulation. On clicking the button again, the recording stops. The recorded animation and the original stage (with all physics disabled) are saved to the ``recordings`` folder in the current working directory. The files are stored in the ``usd`` format:"
