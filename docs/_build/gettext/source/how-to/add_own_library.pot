msgid "Isaac Lab comes pre-integrated with a number of libraries (such as RSL-RL, RL-Games, SKRL, Stable Baselines, etc.). However, you may want to integrate your own library with Isaac Lab or use a different version of the libraries than the one installed by Isaac Lab. This is possible as long as the library is available as Python package that supports the Python version used by the underlying simulator. For instance, if you are using Isaac Sim 2023.1.1, you need to ensure that the library is available for Python 3.10."
