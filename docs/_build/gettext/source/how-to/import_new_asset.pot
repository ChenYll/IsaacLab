msgid "NVIDIA Omniverse relies on the Universal Scene Description (USD) file format to import and export assets. USD is an open source file format developed by Pixar Animation Studios. It is a scene description format optimized for large-scale, complex data sets. While this format is widely used in the film and animation industry, it is less common in the robotics community."

msgid "An important note to use assets for large-scale simulation is to ensure that they are in `instanceable`_ format. This allows the asset to be efficiently loaded into memory and used multiple times in a scene. Otherwise, the asset will be loaded into memory multiple times, which can cause performance issues. For more details on instanceable assets, please check the Isaac Sim `documentation`_."

msgid "Isaac Sim includes the URDF and MJCF importers by default. These importers support the option to import assets as instanceable assets. By selecting this option, the importer will create two USD files: one for all the mesh data and one for all the non-mesh data (e.g. joints, rigid bodies, etc.). The prims in the mesh data file are referenced in the non-mesh data file. This allows the mesh data (which is often bulky) to be loaded into memory only once and used multiple times in a scene."
