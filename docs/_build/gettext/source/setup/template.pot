msgid "Traditionally, building new projects that utilize Isaac Lab's features required creating your own extensions within the Isaac Lab repository. However, this approach can obscure project visibility and complicate updates from one version of Isaac Lab to another. To circumvent these challenges, we now provide a pre-configured and customizable `extension template <https://github.com/isaac-sim/IsaacLabExtensionTemplate>`_ for creating projects in an isolated environment."
